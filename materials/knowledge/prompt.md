### Enhance visual and frontend code generation

For frontend code generation, you can steer Claude 4 models to create complex, detailed, and interactive designs by providing explicit encouragement:

**Sample prompt**
```
Don't hold back. Give it your all.
```

You can also improve Claude's frontend performance in specific areas by providing additional modifiers and details on what to focus on:

*   “Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible”
*   “Add thoughtful details like hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions”
*   “Create an impressive demonstration showcasing web development capabilities”
*   “Apply design principles: hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement”

### Add context to improve performance

Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude 4 better understand your goals and deliver more targeted responses.

**Example: Formatting preferences**

**Less effective:**
```
NEVER use ellipses
```

**More effective:**
```
Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never...
```

**Example: Creating an analytics dashboard**

**Less effective:**
```

**More effective:**
```
