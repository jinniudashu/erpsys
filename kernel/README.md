# Kernel Layer - Workflow Execution Engine

The **Kernel Layer** is the runtime engine that executes business processes designed in the Design Layer. This layer implements an OS-inspired process management system that treats business operations as schedulable computational processes.

## Core Architecture

### Process-as-OS-Process Metaphor

The kernel implements business process management using operating system concepts:
- **Process Control Block (PCB)** - Each business operation becomes a schedulable process
- **Process States** - NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, SUSPENDED, TERMINATED
- **Resource Scheduling** - CPU scheduling algorithms applied to business resource allocation
- **Context Switching** - Operators can switch between different business activities
- **Priority-based Execution** - Business processes execute based on priority queues

### Core Components

## Process Management Core

**Process Model** - The central entity representing business operations:
- **PID Management** - Unique process identifiers with auto-increment
- **State Management** - Complete process lifecycle tracking
- **Hierarchical Processes** - Parent-child and sequential process relationships
- **Entity Binding** - Generic foreign key binding to any business entity
- **Operator Assignment** - Resource allocation and task assignment
- **Service Integration** - Links to service definitions from design layer

**Process States** (types.py):
```python
ProcessState.NEW       # Initial state when process is created
ProcessState.READY     # Ready for execution, waiting for operator
ProcessState.RUNNING   # Currently being executed by an operator
ProcessState.WAITING   # Waiting for external event or resource
ProcessState.SUSPENDED # Temporarily suspended by system or operator
ProcessState.TERMINATED # Process completed or cancelled
```

**ProcessContextSnapshot** - Process state versioning:
- **Version Control** - Track process state changes over time
- **Context Data** - JSON storage of process execution context
- **Hash Verification** - Integrity checking of process state

## Resource Management System

**Resource Abstractions** - Unified resource management:
- **ResourceRequirement** - Abstract resource type definitions
- **ResourceStatus** - Real-time resource availability tracking
- **ResourceCalendar** - Time-based resource scheduling
- **Capacity Management** - Multi-process resource sharing

**Resource Scheduling Algorithm**:
- **Capacity Tracking** - Monitor current resource usage vs. capacity
- **Time Window Management** - Schedule resources within availability windows
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handle resource contention between processes
- **Priority-based Allocation** - Higher priority processes get resource preference

## Operator Management

**Operator Model** - Human resource management:
- **Task Assignment** - Operators receive and execute processes
- **Context Switching** - Switch between different business activities
- **Role-based Access** - Service permissions through role assignments
- **Task Lists** - Manage operator workloads and priorities

**Operator Methods**:
- `get_task_list(state_set)` - Retrieve processes in specific states
- `switch_task(from_process, to_process)` - Context switching between tasks
- `allowed_services()` - Get services accessible to operator based on roles

## Event-Driven Architecture

**Event Processing System** - Automated workflow triggers:
- **Signal-based Automation** - Django signals trigger process state changes
- **Expression Evaluation** - Dynamic condition checking for workflow rules
- **Real-time State Synchronization** - Automatic process state updates
- **Decoupled Communication** - Components communicate through events

**Event Model** - Trigger condition definitions:
- **Expression Parsing** - Evaluate complex business logic conditions
- **Parameter Passing** - Event-specific data transmission
- **Timer Events** - Schedule-based process automation

## Business Rules Engine

**ServiceRule Model** - Workflow automation logic:
- **Event-Service Binding** - Connect triggers to business operations
- **Instruction Execution** - System command processing
- **Entity Integration** - Rules operate on any business entity type
- **Parameter Configuration** - Flexible rule parameterization

**Rule Evaluation Process**:
1. **Event Detection** - Monitor for trigger conditions
2. **Expression Evaluation** - Check if conditions are met
3. **Service Activation** - Execute associated business services
4. **State Updates** - Update process and entity states
5. **Next Process Creation** - Chain to subsequent operations

## Scheduler Engine

**Process Scheduler** (scheduler.py) - Core execution management:
- **Priority Queues** - Manage process execution order
- **Resource Allocation** - Assign resources to ready processes
- **Time Management** - Handle scheduled and time-window processes
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute work across available operators

**Scheduling Algorithms**:
- **Priority-based Scheduling** - Execute higher priority processes first
- **Resource-aware Scheduling** - Consider resource availability
- **Time-constrained Scheduling** - Handle scheduled and deadline processes
- **Operator Workload Balancing** - Distribute tasks effectively

## Signal System

**Process Signals** (signals.py) - Automated state management:
- **State Change Triggers** - Automatic process lifecycle management
- **Resource Updates** - Real-time resource status synchronization
- **Event Propagation** - Cascade effects across related processes
- **Audit Trail Generation** - Track all process state changes

## System Integration

### Design Layer Integration
- **Service Execution** - Execute services defined in design layer
- **Resource Requirements** - Honor resource specifications from services
- **Form Integration** - Display forms associated with processes
- **Entity Binding** - Connect to entities defined in design layer

### Application Layer Integration
- **Model Binding** - Processes can bind to any application model
- **Business Logic Execution** - Trigger business operations on entities
- **Data Flow Management** - Coordinate data between processes and entities

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Process Coordination
- **Parent-Child Processes** - Hierarchical process structures
- **Sequential Processes** - Chain processes in workflows
- **Parallel Execution** - Multiple processes on same entity
- **Synchronization Points** - Coordinate parallel workflows

### Resource Optimization
- **Capacity Planning** - Optimize resource utilization
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handle resource contention
- **Scheduling Optimization** - Minimize wait times and maximize throughput
- **Resource Forecasting** - Predict resource needs

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **Process Rollback** - Revert processes to previous states
- **Error State Management** - Handle process failures gracefully
- **Recovery Procedures** - Automatic and manual recovery mechanisms
- **Audit and Compliance** - Track all process activities

## Usage Patterns

### Process Creation
```python
process = Process.objects.create(
    service=service,
    entity_content_object=business_entity,
    operator=assigned_operator,
    state=ProcessState.READY.name
)
```

### Resource Allocation
```python
# Check resource availability
if resource_status.current_usage < resource_status.capacity:
    # Allocate resource to process
    process.state = ProcessState.RUNNING.name
```

### Event-Driven Automation
```python
# ServiceRule triggers when event conditions are met
if event.evaluate_expression(process_context):
    execute_system_instruction(instruction, process)
    create_next_process(operand_service, entity)
```
